Concert Club - First full-stack project
Link: (will be inserted here once project is finished)

# Test
this is a test to see if I successfully configured the SSH key for my laptop and can successfully push to github.

# TO-DO:
- Add a signup page enabling new users to sign up for an account
- Allow logged-in users to add a review via the frontend rather than making an API call, and edit a previous review they have left
- Add an SSL certificate
- Have database delete old profile pictures rather than keeping them in the frontend
- Add a fully-functional map that displays nearest concerts within a mile-radius based on the user's location
- Set up email via AWS
- Add actual reviews with user photos and not lorem ipsum text
- Site UI change
- Set up Postman documentation for the API
