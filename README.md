# Concerto

## Description
This full-stack project allows users to find which cities their favourite artists will perform concerts in when they go on tour. Featuring MongoDB Databases, RESTful APIs, and AWS Cloud services on the backend, while using Pug, CSS and JS for the frontend, Concerto will be sure to blow your mind and rock your ears.

## Planned future features
*   Add email sending upon creating an account (once Amazon approves my SES request üôè)
*   Add a 'Forgot your password?' page where users can regain access to their account via email.
*   Add an SSL certificate
*   Add an 'About' page so users understand the details of this project
*   Add add the ability to comment directly on the page with logged in users rather than strictly via the API. Will need to investigate ways of moderating this, however, before releasing this feature.
